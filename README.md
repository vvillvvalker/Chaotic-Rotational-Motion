This project was conducted as a mentorship at the Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics under Dr. Shayne Johnston.
It was inspired by a chapter in _Computational Physics_ by Nicholas Giordano and Hisao Nakanishi, though none of the source code was used here.
The project is written in Python. It's not very efficient, but to the best of my understanding, it's accurate.
